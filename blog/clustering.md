Clustering is an important task in machine learning and data mining.

Here, I will list the traditional and modern clustering methods. If you want to cluster something. This blog may help you.

For each clustering methods, there are three things to kind in mind:
- What is the clustering objective? Show the objective function?
- What is the input?
- What is the output?

# K-Means
- The clustering objective: minimize the inertia or within-cluster sum-of-squares:\\( a^2 = b^2 \\)
\ \sum_i^n \

$`\sqrt{2}`$
