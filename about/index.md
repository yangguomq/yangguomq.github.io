## About Me
I am currently a PhD candidate at Department of Computing, Macquarie University, supervised by Professor [Jian Yang](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~jian/) and Dr. [Jia Wu](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~jiawu/). I obtained M.E. from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn) in 2016 and B.E. from [North China Electric Power University](https://english.ncepu.edu.cn) in 2013. Before I started my PhD,  I worked as a Hardware Architecture Engineer at Huawei.

## Research Interests
My current interest focus on intelligent transportation system:

- Vehicles Dispatching Optimization

- Spatial-temporal Data Mining

- Travel Demand Prediction

During my master study, I was interested in biotribology of medical implant device (e.g. Total Knee Replacement).
